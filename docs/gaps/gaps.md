# Lathe — Gaps

This is the single active gap registry for Lathe.
Every open gap, across all areas, lives here, follows the shared [gap lifecycle](gap-process.md)
(a `Status` and a `Target`), and is discovered and triaged through the [gap workflow](gap-workflow.md).
Resolved (`done` / `non-goal`) gaps move to [gaps-archive.md](gaps-archive.md).

## Areas

Each gap keeps its area prefix; the area is the discovery family, not a strict feature taxonomy.

| Prefix | Area | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `EG-NNN` | exploration | Live-probing of nav, hover, search, completion, code actions, hierarchies, against Helidon, Dropwizard, and the `@Builder`-heavy sample-workspace workspace |
| `FR-NNN` | references | `textDocument/references` scope, failure propagation, coverage |
| `CA-N` | code-action | `textDocument/codeAction` providers |
| `CQ-NNNN` | completion | Completion quality; checked against the completion [expectations](../planned/lathe-completion-expectations.md) contract |

## Finding the work for a release

The slice for a release is derived, not hand-maintained: every gap with `Status: accepted` and the
matching `Target` (see [gap-process.md](gap-process.md)).

```bash
grep -nE '^(Status|Target):|^\*\*Status' docs/gaps/gaps.md     # scan active entries
grep -n 'Target: M1' docs/gaps/gaps.md                         # the M1 slice
```

Entries follow, grouped by area: exploration (EG) below, then Find References (FR), Code Actions
(CA), and Completion (CQ).

EG-003 is deferred until after M2 because it requires `DocTrees` attribution of Javadoc comment
positions,
which is a non-trivial hover extension.

## EG-003 — Hover returns null on positions inside Javadoc type-reference tags

**Status: accepted — Target: M3**

### Observed behaviour

Pressing `K` (hover) on a type name inside a Javadoc `{@link …}` or `{@see …}` reference tag
returns no result.

```java
/**
 * ... {@link Scheduling} ...     ← hover on 'Scheduling' → null
 * @see TaskManager               ← hover on 'TaskManager' → null
 */
```

Type names at the same or nearby positions in source code resolve correctly.

### Root cause

The Javadoc region is not attributed for reference resolution.
The cursor position falls inside a `DocCommentTree` or raw comment block that javac does not
include in the attributed element table.
`HoverLocator` (or equivalent) receives a position whose `TreePath` resolves to a Javadoc
comment node, finds no attributed element, and returns null.

### Proposed fix

Two-phase lookup for positions inside Javadoc:

1. Detect that the cursor falls inside a `DocCommentTree` (by checking `DocTrees.getDocComment`
   and comparing character offsets).
2. Extract the referenced type name from the `{@link}`, `{@see}`, or `@throws` tag using
   `DocTrees.getElement(DocTreePath)`.
3. Delegate to the normal hover path with that resolved element.

This is a bounded change: only `HoverLocator` and possibly a helper on `SourceAnalysisSession`
need modification.

### Probe commands

```bash
printf 'hover "Scheduling"\n' \
  | python3 dev/explore.py \
      /home/ag-libs/git/helidon/scheduling/src/main/java/io/helidon/scheduling/Scheduling.java
```

## EG-017 — `textDocument/documentHighlight` not implemented

**Status: accepted — Target: M3**

### Observed behaviour

The server does not advertise `documentHighlightProvider`, and no handler exists.
Cursor-occurrence highlighting — the read/write highlight an editor draws for every occurrence of
the symbol under the cursor as the cursor rests — is therefore unavailable.

### Root cause

`LatheLanguageServer.initialize` registers no `documentHighlightProvider`, and there is no
`documentHighlight` request handler in the server.

Spec: [LSP 3.17 — Document Highlights Request](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#textDocument_documentHighlight).
Params are `TextDocumentPositionParams` (same cursor target as references); the response is
`DocumentHighlight[]`, each a `range` plus optional `DocumentHighlightKind` (`Text=1`, `Read=2`,
`Write=3`, default `Text`). Eclipse JDT LS implements this via `DocumentHighlightHandler`/
`computeOccurrences` and returns the same LSP4J types Lathe uses, so this is parity work.

### Proposed fix

Server side: implement `textDocument/documentHighlight` as a file-scoped specialisation of the
existing exact same-file reference matching.
Reuse the `ReferenceTarget` identity already used by Find References, restrict the scan to the
current document (run against the already-attributed open-file analysis — never recompile — and make
it cancellable, since it fires per cursor-rest), and map each occurrence to a `DocumentHighlight`
with `Read`/`Write` kind (`ReferenceRole.READ/WRITE → Read/Write`, otherwise `Text`) based on whether
the occurrence is an assignment target. The range-dedup added for FR-008 already prevents a record
component's header from being highlighted once per synthetic member.

The same-file matching machinery already exists, so the server work is small and the feature is
exercised continuously during normal editing.

### Client integration (Neovim) — not server-only

Advertising the capability is not sufficient for a visible effect in the shipped plugin:

- `lua/lathe.lua` sends full `make_client_capabilities()` (so the capability negotiates), but wires
  only a `format_on_save` `LspAttach` autocmd — there is **no** `document_highlight` autocmd, so
  nothing highlights automatically.
- Stock Neovim users need a buffer-local `LspAttach` block (mirroring the `format_on_save` one,
  capability-guarded on `client:supports_method('textDocument/documentHighlight')`) that calls
  `vim.lsp.buf.document_highlight()` on `CursorHold`/`CursorHoldI` and `vim.lsp.buf.clear_references()`
  on `CursorMoved`/`CursorMovedI`, plus guidance to lower `updatetime` (~250ms; default 4000ms is too
  slow) and ensure `LspReferenceText/Read/Write` highlight groups are visible.
- `vim-illuminate` users get it for free: its default provider order is `{'lsp','treesitter','regex'}`,
  so advertising the capability silently upgrades them to semantic LSP highlighting.

This gap therefore ships as **server handler + a small `lathe.lua` autocmd** (behind an opt-out flag
like `format_on_save`); a server-only change would leave the feature half-wired for stock users.

### Probe commands

Not probeable through `explore.py` (no `documentHighlight` command); confirmed by the absent
capability and the absent handler in `LatheLanguageServer`.

### Regression targets

- `DocumentHighlightTest.documentHighlight_localVariable_highlightsReadAndWriteOccurrences`
- `DocumentHighlightTest.documentHighlight_methodName_highlightsSameFileCalls`

## EG-018 — `textDocument/selectionRange` not implemented

**Status: accepted — Target: M3**

### Observed behaviour

The server does not advertise `selectionRangeProvider`, and no handler exists.
Expand-selection and shrink-selection (a common editing keystroke) are unavailable.

The `selectionRange` occurrences in the server source are unrelated: they are the
`DocumentSymbol.selectionRange` and `CallHierarchyItem.selectionRange` fields, not the
`textDocument/selectionRange` feature.

Spec: [LSP 3.17 — Selection Range Request](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#textDocument_selectionRange).
Params carry `positions: Position[]` (multiple cursors); the response is a `SelectionRange[]` aligned
to those positions, each a linked chain `{ range, parent? }` where every `parent` is a strictly
larger enclosing range. This is request-driven (an explicit keystroke), not ambient, so latency is
not critical. Eclipse JDT LS implements it (`SelectionRangeHandler`, PR #1101) by chaining ranges
built from the AST, with extra handling for line/block comments — so this is parity work.

### Root cause

`LatheLanguageServer.initialize` registers no `selectionRangeProvider`, and there is no
`selectionRange` request handler.

### Proposed fix

Implement `textDocument/selectionRange` syntactically.
For each requested position, walk the enclosing `TreePath` from the leaf outward and emit a nested
chain of `SelectionRange` entries (identifier → expression → statement → block → member → type).
This needs only source positions, not type resolution, so it can run on the parsed tree without a
full attribution pass. Emit strictly-increasing ranges (dedup identical spans), and — as jdtls does
— handle a cursor inside a comment, which is not an AST node and would otherwise have no enclosing
leaf to walk from.

### Client integration (Neovim) — low marginal value here

Unlike EG-017, this needs no plugin wiring, and its payoff in Neovim is limited:

- Neovim 0.12 exposes it built-in via `vim.lsp.buf.selection_range(direction, timeout_ms)` (positive
  expands, negative shrinks) plus visual-mode `an`/`in` text objects; pre-0.12 users used the
  `nvim-lsp-selection-range` plugin. A coder just binds keys — no `lathe.lua` change required beyond
  advertising the capability.
- Crucially, Neovim's `an`/`in` uses **Treesitter as the primary provider and LSP only as a
  fallback**. Lathe's `ftplugin/java.lua` already starts the Java Treesitter parser, so users already
  have expand/shrink selection today; the LSP version would rarely be reached. This is why EG-018 is
  a weaker candidate than EG-017 (which filled a genuinely absent feature and auto-upgraded
  vim-illuminate users).

### Probe commands

Not probeable through `explore.py` (no `selectionRange` command); confirmed by the absent
capability and the absent handler in `LatheLanguageServer`.

### Regression targets

- `SelectionRangeTest.selectionRange_insideExpression_returnsNestedSyntacticRanges`
- `SelectionRangeTest.selectionRange_atMethodName_expandsToMemberThenType`

## EG-028 — `textDocument/onTypeFormatting` is a stub and is not registered

**Status: accepted — Target: M3**

### Observed behaviour

Typing in Google-Java-Format code with complex wrapped structure (assignment continuations at +8,
wrapped call arguments at +12, multi-line record headers at +4) leaves the cursor at the wrong
indentation when a new line is started.
The server provides no type-time indentation assistance.

### Root cause

`LatheTextDocumentService.onTypeFormatting` (around line 312) is a TODO stub that returns
`List.of()` for every request, and `LatheLanguageServer.initialize` does not register a
`documentOnTypeFormattingProvider` (no `firstTriggerCharacter` / `moreTriggerCharacter`), so most
clients never send the request at all.

### Constraint (why this cannot fully close the indentation gap)

Lathe's only formatting engine is Google Java Format, which parses the **entire compilation unit**
before emitting anything and throws `FormatterException` on unparseable input (`JavaFormatter`
catches it and returns no edits).
Its range API parses the whole file too — ranges only limit which edits are emitted.
The most useful `onTypeFormatting` trigger, newline (`\n`) inside a wrapped expression or record
header, fires precisely when the buffer is **not parseable**, so a GJF-backed handler can return
nothing there.
The CLAUDE.md "no ad hoc Java parsing" rule forbids a hand-rolled indentation model as the
alternative.

### Realistic scope

`onTypeFormatting` is at best a **partial** improvement, scoped to triggers that tend to *complete*
a parseable file (`}`, `;`): when the file parses again, run GJF (range-scoped to the touched lines)
and return conservative edits for brace/statement layout.
It will not fix the live-newline cursor case.
Conservative behaviour depends on EG-029 (real range formatting) landing first.
Because the editor already formats on save (full-document GJF), the saved result is GJF-correct
regardless, so this is a live-typing nicety, not a correctness requirement — which is why it is
parked at `backlog`.
The lever that actually fixes the newline/record-component cursor is error-tolerant client-side
indentation (e.g. tree-sitter), not the server.

### Probe commands

Not probeable through `explore.py`; confirmed by the stub handler and the absent capability
registration in `LatheLanguageServer`.

### Regression targets

- `OnTypeFormattingTest.onTypeFormatting_closingBraceCompletesFile_returnsConservativeEdits`
- `OnTypeFormattingTest.onTypeFormatting_unparseableNewline_returnsNoEdits`

## EG-029 — `rangeFormat` ignores its range and formats the whole document

**Status: accepted — Target: M3**

### Observed behaviour

`textDocument/rangeFormatting` reformats the entire document instead of only the requested range,
so a range-format request can move and reflow code far outside the selection.

### Root cause

Both the `formatting` and `rangeFormatting` endpoints delegate to the same
`WorkspaceSession.format(tag, uri)` (`LatheTextDocumentService` lines ~302 and ~309), which calls
`JavaFormatter.format(content)` — a whole-document `Formatter().formatSourceAndFixImports(content)`.
The selection range carried by the request is never read.

### Proposed fix

Add a range-aware path in `JavaFormatter` using GJF's `formatSource(text, ranges)` with the
character range derived from the request's LSP range, and emit only the resulting in-range edits.
Keep the whole-document path for `formatting`.
This is a prerequisite for a conservative EG-028 (`}`/`;` on-type formatting that touches only the
edited region).

### Probe commands

Not probeable through `explore.py`; confirmed by both endpoints sharing the whole-document
`JavaFormatter.format` path in `WorkspaceSession`.

### Regression targets

- `RangeFormattingTest.rangeFormat_selectionInsideMethod_editsOnlySelectedLines`
- `RangeFormattingTest.rangeFormat_unchangedSelection_returnsNoEdits`

## Implementation notes

The release slice is derived from the gap fields, not maintained as an ordered list here: the work
for a release is every gap with `Status: accepted` and the matching `Target` (see
[gap-process.md](gap-process.md)).

Guidance that does not fall out of the fields:

- Do **EG-007** (WARNING flood) early — it improves log signal for debugging everything else.
- Implement **EG-023 with EG-008** (shared `Object`-method suppression list).
- Implement **EG-021 with EG-006** (shared reactor-origin ranking).
- **EG-014** and **EG-015** reuse the override-resolution walk from **EG-012** (already implemented).

# Completion Gaps (CQ)

Active completion-quality gaps. Discovered and triaged via the completion appendix of the
[gap workflow](gap-workflow.md); checked against the completion [expectations](../planned/lathe-completion-expectations.md)
contract. Resolved CQ entries are in [gaps-archive.md](gaps-archive.md).

## CQ-0002 — Method-reference completion returns no candidates

ID: CQ-0002
Status: accepted
Target: M3
Tier: assistive
Failure mode: missing-candidate
Owner component: SentinelInjector / SentinelParser

Project/file:
`/home/ag-libs/git/helidon/dbclient/tracing/src/main/java/io/helidon/dbclient/tracing/DbClientTracingProvider.java`

Probe command:
```bash
printf 'complete after "List::" expect of min 1\nlog 30\n' \
  | python3 dev/explore.py /home/ag-libs/git/helidon/dbclient/tracing/src/main/java/io/helidon/dbclient/tracing/DbClientTracingProvider.java
```

Related project/file:
`/home/ag-libs/git/helidon/dbclient/mongodb/src/main/java/io/helidon/dbclient/mongodb/MongoDbClientBuilder.java`

Related probe:
```bash
printf 'complete after "this::" expect url username password min 1\nlog 30\n' \
  | python3 dev/explore.py /home/ag-libs/git/helidon/dbclient/mongodb/src/main/java/io/helidon/dbclient/mongodb/MongoDbClientBuilder.java
```

Cursor context:
```java
config.asNodeList().orElseGet(List::of)
connConfig.get("url").asString().ifPresent(this::url)
```

IntelliJ or JDT behavior:
Expected IDE behavior is method-reference completion after `Type::` and `this::`.

Lathe behavior:
No completions are returned.
The log shows `parsed valid=false sentinelCtx=null` after `List::` and after `this::`.

Expected Lathe behavior:
Eventually,
method-reference completion should offer compatible methods for the receiver and target functional interface.

Accepted edit, if relevant:
Accepting `of` after `List::` should produce `List::of`.
Accepting `url` after `this::` should produce `this::url`.

Future design:
Method-reference completion is deferred until after M2.
The first implementation slice should be basic receiver-member listing,
not full smart compatibility filtering.
Add a `METHOD_REFERENCE` sentinel site,
detect `::`,
capture receiver text similarly to member access,
and route simple cases through member candidate generation.
`TypeName::` should offer static methods such as `List::of`;
`this::` should offer visible instance methods such as `this::url`;
ordinary expression receivers such as `service::` should offer instance methods.
Expected functional-interface filtering should be a later slice,
because robust compatibility needs the target type from contexts such as `orElseGet`,
`ifPresent`,
and `stream.map`.
Constructor references such as `TypeName::new` and array constructor references are also later slices.

Regression target:
Future method-reference completion test class or `CompletionEngineTest` method-reference section.

Notes:
This matches the existing deferred method-reference gap in the historical completion docs.
